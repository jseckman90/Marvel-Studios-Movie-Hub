# Marvel Studios Movie Hub:
Is an application that allows the user to scroll through the 3 phases of the MCU and click on a Marvel movie poster within that phase to display movie information such as title, release date, plot, and relevant characters

# Technologies Used
The Movie Database API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to get movie information (title, release date, plot, characters)
Online Movie Database API (http://www.omdbapi.com/) to get movie poster urls
HTML
CSS Flexbox
JavaScript
jQuery
AJAX

# Unsolved Problems
Trouble with figuring out how to make all movie posters fit on one line as opposed to wrapping and expanding the container.  Phase 3 movies particularly since there are 11 movies.

# Future additions
Pull in super hero biographies from Marvels API or Super Hero API so when you click a characters name, a bio is displayed
Add a search
Add movie trailers to the move info section
